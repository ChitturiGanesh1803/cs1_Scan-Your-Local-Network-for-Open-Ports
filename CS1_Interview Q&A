1. What is an open port?

An open port is a network port that is actively listening for connections. It means some service or application behind that port is reachable.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?

Nmap sends a SYN packet to a port.

If it gets SYN/ACK, the port is open.

If it gets RST, the port is closed.
It never completes the full handshake, which keeps it fast and less noticeable.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?

Open ports expose services. If the service is vulnerable, outdated, or misconfigured, an attacker can exploit it. Even unnecessary open ports widen the attack surface.

4. Difference between TCP and UDP scanning

TCP scanning relies on clear handshake responses, so results are reliable.
UDP scanning has no handshake. Most ports don’t respond at all, so it’s slower and harder to interpret.

5. How can open ports be secured?

Disable services you don’t use

Restrict access with firewall rules

Use strong authentication

Keep services updated

6. What is a firewall’s role regarding ports?

A firewall controls which ports can accept or send traffic. It can block unwanted ports, limit access, or log suspicious activity.

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?

A port scan is checking which ports are open on a device. Attackers do it to map the system and find entry points they can exploit.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?

While Nmap shows results, Wireshark shows the packets behind the scenes. You can see the SYN/SYN-ACK/RST flow, understand why a port appears open or closed, and troubleshoot anomalies.
